*Version 0.2.0*

- overhaul of the Character Sheet and addition of a NPC sheet, both with dark mode!
- The sheet is compatible to most languages - occasionally there is a word that is particularly long and may be cut of or break out of its field. Some modules have their own css that changes the sheets css. As far as I have tested the available languages only Korean breaks the layout with the modules css.

** Character Sheet **
- Attributes, Skills and Traits got a little more compact to make room for the favorites.
- Because of that there no longer is the need for the collapse-buttons for traits and favorites.
- Fvorites can still be toggled to show & edit or hide empty trait fields.
- traits got a bit reorganized: the size slect is now located below the character name, the special traits button is now below the traits list.

** New NPC Sheet **
The default NPC sheet was reoganized.

- The general layout was fitted to the character sheet with the option for a round portrait and Hit Point Overlay.
- The attributes were put into the header to be always visible.
- the tabs were reduced to a single tab containing all abilities.
- skills and traits only show proficient skills or available traits. They can be toggled to show all & edit.
